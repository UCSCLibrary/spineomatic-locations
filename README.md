# Spineomatic Locations file

This repository hosts the locations file for Spineomatic, the label printing software for Metadata Services.

The application is provided a folder URL, and looks there for an aboveLabel.txt file. 

Thus the application has https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCSCLibrary/spineomatic-locations/master/ stored as the URL, and it will find the text file in this repository.
